Leylines Server Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------------

Requirements:
- Python 2.5 or higher (not compatible with 3.x)
- Linux (tested on Ubuntu Server 14.10)
- or Plan 9 (tested on 9front running on a qemu virtual machine)

Install
- Clone the repo onto the server.
- Default port for leylines is defined in config.py as 65006.
	If changed, you must alter client to match.

Start
- To start leylines server type: python main.py
	RECOMMENDED:
	(add '-d' command line arg to get debug printing to console)


Stop
- To stop leylines server, you must send a die message. You can
	do this locally or remotely with the stop.sh script:
	
	'./stop.sh [address] [port]

	e.g. (if running locally) ./stop.sh localhost 65006

	This will send the message to the server to cease all operations. Leylines server is a multi-threaded program that cannot be killed with Ctrl-C. Note: if you shut down the server, you may have to wait a minute or two for the port to free up before restarting.

Clean
- To erase all user profiles, logs and reset the server, you can run the clean.sh script:

	./clean.sh all - erases all profiles, uid_list and logs.
	./clean.sh [profile_id] - erases the requested profile, but this option is not fully tested and has some known weaknesses.
